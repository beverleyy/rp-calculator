# A-level rank point calculator

Younger sister was collecting A-level results and complained that the online RP calculators would be overloaded with traffic, so she requested I upload this code that I wrote 6 years ago when I was taking my own A-level result.

Formulae: Grade*Multiplier where Grade is according to the table below and Multiplier is 1 for H2 and 0.5 for H1 subjects.

| Grade | Points |
| ----- | ------ |
|   A   |   20   |
|   B   |  17.5  |
|   C   |   15   |
|   D   |  12.5  |
|   E   |   10   |
|   S   |    5   |
|   U   |    0   |

For MTL, the grade is added according to the above table as well and then the entire score is rebased by 0.9.
